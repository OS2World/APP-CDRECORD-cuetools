cuetools
--------

DESCRIPTION
cuetools is a set of utilities for working with cue files and toc files.

COMMON OPTIONS
-t cue|toc		set file type to cue or toc
-f <file>		specify cue/toc file

cue/toc files are specified using -f <file>.  <file> can be specified as "-" to
indicate stdin for input files, and stdout for output files.  If <file> does
not have a ".cue" or ".toc" suffix, or is "-", the file type must be specified
using -t cue|toc.


cueconvert
----------

DESCRIPTION
cueconvert reads a cue/toc file, and outputs a cue/toc file.

SYNTAX
cueconvert [-t cue|toc] -f <infile> [-t cue|toc] -f <outfile>


cuebreakpoints
--------------

DESCRIPTION
cuebreakpoints reads a cue/toc file, and outputs track break points in a
format usable by shnsplit (part of the shntool package).

SYNTAX
cuebreakpoints [-t cue|toc] -f <file>


cuerename
---------

DESCRIPTION
cuerename renames files based on a template string using information from a
cue/toc file.

The first file is renamed to the expanded format string (for the first track),
and so on until there are no more files or tracks.

SYNTAX
cuerename [-o options] [-v] [-t cue|toc] -f <file> file...

OPTIONS
-v				verbose; print filenames
-o options			comma separated string of options:
   case=none|lower|upper	perform case conversion
   underscore			replace spaces with underscores
   strict[=CHARS]		strict filenames (only allow safe characters),
   				can optionally specify allowable characters
   				(besides alphanumeric)
   nostrict			do not use strict filenames
   replace=FROM/TO		replace occurances of FROM with TO
   template=TEMPLATE		set template (see Template Expansion)
   test				test mode; do not move files, implies -v
   notest			unset test mode

Characters in replace=FROM/TO can be escaped by prefixing a '\'.  This makes it possible
to replace a '/'.

Template Expansion
%N - number of tracks
%n - track number
%T - album title
%t - track title
%M - album message
%m - track message
%A - album performer
%a - track performer
%G - album genre
%g - track genre
%F - original filename suffix (not including '.')
%f - original filename prefix (not including '.')
%. - '.' if original filename contains one

Any other %<character> is expanded to that character.  For example, to get a
'%', use %%.

%. may expand to '.' even if strict=CHARS does not contain a '.'.

"%f%.%F" will expand to the original filename, with any options (case,
underscore, strict) applied to the prefix and suffix.

Option File
Options may also be set in ~/.cuerenamerc .  This file has rigid formatting
requirements.  Each line may have one or more comma seperated options.  The
options must be of the format "option[=VALUE]".  Unlike the command line
options, the VALUE should not be quoted.

Lines which begin with '#' are comments, and are ignored.

Options set on the command line override those set in the option file.
